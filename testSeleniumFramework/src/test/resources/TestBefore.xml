The order of proof typically organizes and details all admissible proof (documents, deposition testimony, discovery responses and so on) in the order in which it would be presented at trial.</para><para> In crafting this outline, the moving party must consider who bears the burden of proof for each claim or defense and structure the summary judgment motion accordingly. If the moving party bears the burden of proof for a claim or defense at trial, she carries the burden at the summary judgment stage.
